# 12 microservices Deployment on AWS EKS using Helm 

This application  is a sample microservice application you can use as a sandbox to test and learn containerised application orchestration and monitoring techniques. It is not intended to be a comprehensive reference example of how to write a microservices application, although you will better understand some of those concepts by playing with this application . To be clear, the error handling is patchy and there is not any security built into the application.

every microservice has dockerfile assciated with it and EKS manifests,Helm charts are provided in this repository .


This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies:
- NodeJS [([Express](http://expressjs.com/))]
- Java ([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/))
- Python ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org))
- Golang
- PHP (Apache)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- MySQL ([Maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com) data)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx
- AngularJS (1.x)
